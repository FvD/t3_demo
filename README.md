T3 (Tychobra Time Tracker)

Live App: https://tychobra.shinyapps.io/t3_demo/

This is a demo Shiny application.  It is a modified version of our internal t3 Shiny application that we use to track out time.  Time is tracked by client and project.

This demo uses an SQLite database. You should be able to clone this repo and run the app locally.
